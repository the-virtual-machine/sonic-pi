I should be doing other things but I am too excited by this project.  
In the last few days I have bought thevirtualmachine.live and livecoding.info  
Ive been setting them up and configuring everything. I have alot of excitement
around this project. There is alot to do.

It can be overwhelming at first and I tend to plan but this could be the thing
that I need to overcome my perfectionism and need to organize.  Livecoding is an
excercise in creation and destruction and I might be able to round myself out 
by focusing on experimenting and not doing things perfectly.  

I would like to post the following:  
- Review of ICLC whitepapers, starting with Dj Dave and Lil Datas recent
whitepaper on [Pop live coding](https://zenodo.org/records/11350025)  
- Playing of sonic pi and other live coding samples I find online  
- recording and sharing on soundcloud and always attributing it to the owner.  
- reviewing of code  
- creation of material that help others learn. I have already made a few of
these in the [resources](/resources/) folder.  

I am excited by many concepts in Livecoding, especially Music, computing,
digital culture, h/makerspaces, order/freedom, open source, sharing and learning

Ultimately, I also need to learn to have fun with livecoding itself and expand
on my expertise with the tools.
