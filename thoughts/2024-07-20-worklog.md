Ok! That is now up and running! What a relief  

So what is going on here?  

Hmmm, intorductions are hard  

I am making msuic with Sonic Pi, sharing resources with the 
community and sharing my process as I go.  
This work log is how I can "Show my code", a concept sacred 
in the livecoding world.  

The [Manifestio](https://toplap.org/wiki/ManifestoDraft) states as such;

```
- Give us access to the performer's mind, to the whole human instrument.
- Code should be seen as well as heard, underlying algorithms viewed as well as their visual outcome.
```
My two websites [thevirtualmachine.live](https://thevirtualmachine.live/), and [livecoding.info](https://livecoding.info/) are also forms of code and a creation to which I will share its process.  

These work logs are a way for me to share my mind as I go about doing these things.  

I am also livestreaming the process. I dont think that part is very intertaining but it is important.  
The livestream is happening now at [Youtube - @the_virtual_machine](https://www.youtube.com/@the_virtual_machine)  


Cool, everything seems to be working. Lets check up on livecoding.info and if its up and running as expected.  

Cool! The 301 redirect from livecoding.info -> Streamlit is working. I have a fair amount of experience with Streamlit so I will be using that to create a dashboard of artists.  


------

I think one of my thoughts I have been having here is the difference between work as an item of play and creativity versus that of performance and delivering on an expected outcome and creating a product.  
I tend to want to perform very well and I think there is a perfectionist tendency to not act until I am satisfied that the outcome is flawless - which is a tragic approach to learning anything new.  
My diving into sonic pi, and live coding is a way to take the pressure off from that expectation I hold on myself and explore a bit of freedom that has nothing to do with me as a person. Who I am is irrelevant and I will try to keep it that way.  
What I can create while in a state of play and not judging so much is a far more important item to retain than how I am presented to others.  
That is the lesson I am trying to learn from this anyways.  

Ok, now onto some of the things I just saw from this other video.. One sec

How to connect Sonic pi and Hydra.

Whew, that didnt get deleted.  

Oh yeah one thing I wanted to do that I felt is important is to stream onto a phone sized output.  Its harder for sure but unless I develop alot of post production editing skills(which I dont have the time for rn) then its best to share this way.  Mobile is the present and future.  

I really liked [this](/hydra.ojack.xyz/ritchse.js) random hydra visual...
Lets save it.

We are facing some technical issues in the stream...
